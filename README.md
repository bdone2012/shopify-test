If I was doing this while working for First+Third I would have asked questions before getting started. While I was doing the project I was confused about what functionality of the app was supposed to work similarly to Shopify. 

I was trying to get the Add to Cart button to work with vanilla AJAX but it didn't work. I wound up using jQuery anyway because I wanted to use slick slide. I should have decided before I started the project if I was going to use jQuery or not.

I have used AJAX with Shopify before and I know that I should have posted a quantity and the product id but it wasn't working.

In this project I would have changed the fonts and spent more time on the design overall obviously. I'm not a designer by any means but I often get asked to match things to existing designs. So if this was a real project I would have picked a design that I liked and done something similar.

I wouldn't have used any cdns and would have added the files into the project.

The most fun part was actually the part that was the hardest for me. Generally trying to determine what was going to be similar to Shopify in the app and what wasn't was both frustrating and interesting at the same time like a lot of dev work. Dev work is often the most rewarding when you're trying to figure things out like a puzzle. I enjoyed opening up the node app and looking into hapi. I've never used liquid outside of Shopify before although it's really similar to ruby in my opinion which I do have experience with. But the project was also a bit frustrating because overall it seemed pretty simple and I felt like I was missing something obvious which probably could have been solved quickly by asking some questions before starting the project.
